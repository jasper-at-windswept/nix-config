.SH Basic Syntax
.PP
Variables are formatted like this

.PP
.RS

.nf
variable-name = value;

.fi
.RE

.PP
All values require a semi-colon on the end as shown above.

.PP
When declaring a animation-name you need to use double quotes like such

.PP
When using rule-sets there are two ways to provide windows to it.

.PP
With almost every rule-set it will follow this syntax and structure.

.PP
.RS

.nf
rule-set = [
  "class_g = 'foo'" # Select windows by classname
  "name = 'bar'" # Select windows by name
];

.fi
.RE

.PP
In the example you replace \fB\fCfoo\fR with the \fB\fCWM_CLASS\fR which can be found using the \fB\fCxprop\fR command provided by xorg-xprop
\[la]https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xorg-xprop/\[ra] on Arch and \fB\fCxorg.xprop\fR on NixOS.

.PP
Sometimes \fB\fCxprop\fR will output multiple class names. If the first class name does not work, try the second one.


.SH Options
.SH corner-radius
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to 12 in the sample config\fP

.PP
Adjusts the window corner rounding in pixels.

.SH rounded-corners-exclude []
.PP
\fIBy default this rule-set is empty\fP

.PP
Here you can declare rules of what windows will not have their borders rounded. This can be good for some games that go full screen but still have rounded borders.

Here is an example

.nf
rounded-corners-exclude = [
  "class_g = 'Alacritty'",
];

.RE

.SH corners-rule []
.PP
\fIBy default this rule-set is empty\fP

.PP
Within this rule-set you can explicitly declare the corner-radius of individual windows based on their name or class name attributes.

.PP
It functions in a similar way to \fB\fCopacity-rule\fR in that the number you put before the window name is the amount of rounding you want applied to that window.

.PP
Currently you can only use number 1-100. This may be fixed in later updates.

Shadows tend to be a bit finicky on some window managers, so make sure to play around with it and see what is best for you.

.SH shadow-radius

\fIBy default this is set to 12\fP

.PP
Shadow radius/roundness in pixels.

.SH shadow-opacity

.SH fading
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fCtrue\fR in the sample config\fP

\fIFade windows in/out when opening/closing and when opacity changes\fP

.PP
Fading is required for unmap animations to work.

.SH fade-in-step
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC0.03\fR in the sample config\fP

.PP
\fIOpacity change between steps while fading in. (0.01 - 1.0)\fP

.PP
Increasing this value will result in faster fading in of windows.
Decreasing makes the fading in of windows take longer. (This does not means the animations take longer, just the fading).

.SH fade-out-step
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC0.03\fR in the sample config\fP

.PP
\fIOpacity change between steps while fading out. (0.01 - 1.0)\fP

.PP
Increasing this value will result in faster fading out AND animating out of windows.
Decreasing this makes fading and animating out take longer.

.SH fade-delta
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC5\fR\fP

.PP
\fIThe time between steps in fade step, in milliseconds. ( > 0)\fP

A list of windows that should never have their opacity changed by \fB\fCactive-opacity\fR when focused.

.SH inactive-exclude []
.PP
\fIBy default this rule-set is empty\fP

.PP
A list of windows that should have their \fB\fCinactive-opacity\fR set to whatever the \fB\fCactive-opacity\fR is. Unless the window is also in \fB\fCactive-opacity-exclude\fR then it will be set to \fB\fC1.0\fR or if it is set in \fB\fCopacity-rule\fR it will use the opacity set there as the \fB\fCinactive-opacity\fR\&.

.SH animations

\fIBy default this option is set to \fB\fCtrue\fR\fP(true/false)

.SH animation-stiffness
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC100\fR\fP

.PP
\fIChanges the stiffness of animations\fP

.PP
What stiffness basically is inferring is how much the window geometry will be stretched when opening/closing windows. It's best illustrated in the video below.

.PP
With a higher stiffness the windows go to the final animation position faster resulting in a snappier looking transition.

.SH animation-window-mass
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC0.5\fR\fP

.PP
\fIChanges the mass of windows\fP

.PP
Modifying the mass of windows makes them virtually heavier and therefore slower to animate.

.SH animation-dampening
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fC10\fR\fP

.PP
\fIChanges the dampening applied to windows during the animation\fP

.PP
This setting basically does what it says. It dampens the animation of windows.

.PP
The more windows are dampened, the slower/softer they come into and out of view.

.SH animation-clamping
.PP
\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fCfalse\fR\fP (true/false)

.PP
\fIToggles window clamping\fP

.PP
Stop the animation from making the window exceed its set geometry. Shoutout to @thecodsman
\[la]https://github.com/thecodsman\[ra] for finding this out.

.PP
Basically if you are using a animation setting that would make the window extend larger than it would be after the animation has played then it will cut the animation off once the window reaches its physical geometry.

.SH animation-for-open-window

\fIBy default this is set to \fB\fCzoom\fR\fP
